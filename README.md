# Jacob Gaudet's Pokedex
Gotta fetch 'em all!

## About
This website is meant to emulate a Pokedex built with Python and Flask that fetches data from the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to display the original 151 Pokemon as cards and categorized by type. Each card features a clickable flip animation to reveal the classic Pokemon card backside in order to make the ui feel more like you're browsing cards and not just the Pokemons data. The site also includes a nav menu for quickly jumping between types and a "Back to top" button for easy browsing.

## Features
- **Pokemon Cards:** Each card displays a Pokemon's image, stats, abilities, id, weight, height, and base xp.
- **Type Categorization:** Pokemon are grouped by their type.
- **Interactive Flip Animation:** Click a card to flip it to view the classic pokemon card backside.
- **User-Friendly Navigation:** Includes a type-based navigation menu and a "Back to Top" button.
